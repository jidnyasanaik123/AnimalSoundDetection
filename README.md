# 📚 OVERVIEW
This project was developed as part of my internship and focuses on creating an interactive educational platform for children (ages 3–8) to learn animal names, sounds, and characteristics. The app also includes games, alphabet learning, number guessing, and math practice modules — making learning fun and interactive.

## 🐶 Animal Sound Recognition App
- Display of wild/domestic/bird animals with images.
- Text-to-speech audio playback of animal names.
- Interactive animal characteristic display (fetched via Groq LLM).
- Speech input: children speak the animal's name and receive feedback (correct/wrong).
- Real-time database logging of child's performance.

## 🎓 Educational Learning Platform
- Learn ABC: Speech-based alphabet learning with images and TTS.
- Progress Dashboard: Charts, metrics, and timelines for each activity based on MySQL data.

## 🌍 Real-World Impact
- Enhances speech recognition and auditory learning for young children.
- Ideal for early childhood educators and parents to track progress.
- Can be extended to include fruits, vehicles, colors, shapes, etc.
- Bridges tech with inclusive, child-friendly learning.
